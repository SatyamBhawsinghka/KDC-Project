# KDC-Project
Generating an A* Optimal Path for Variable Joint Stiffness in an Underactuated System

createMap : discretizes the environment.

createGraph : creates the graph by connecting reachable nodes with edges representing costs.

graphSearch: A* search on the created graph for optimal path.

simulation: visualization of resulting path

Refer to project report for details.
